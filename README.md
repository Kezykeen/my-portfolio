## Getting Started.

Make sure you have nodejs installed by running the following command:

After installing nodejs install [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
if you have it then install the project's dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

to only install for one of the folders(topbar, sidebar, control)

```bash
yarn setup:<FOLDER-NAME>
```
